            <p><span class="image left"><img src="images/self.png" alt="" /></span>
            Many of my hobbies focus around trying and learning new things. I tend to get focused on a new activity and really strive to learn what I need to do it. I've enjoyed 3D printing and building model rockets for fun and as a project team at OSU. A recent activity I've been working on is making my own video games using Unity professional game making software and making art using Blender. Both of which are very outside of my formal education with aerospace engineering, but is a really fun to grow my programming experience while working on a creative project. I also enjoy playing many PC games with my friends as well.</p>

						<p>Hiking is another way I like to spend my time. Living in Boulder, CO as I get my masters degree has certainly been helpful in giving me many great opportunities to enjoy the outdoors. I also enjoy rock climbing, but I've only been able to do so in climbing gyms and have been able to do it outside yet.</p>

						<p>I also really enjoy traveling to new places as well and using those opportunities to grow as a person and expand my perspective of the world. While at OSU I did a study abroad trip to the UK and spent a few weeks learning about the engineering of many their castles and cathedrals, culminating in leading a tour of Harlech Castle in Wales. My internship in Scotland at Astrosat and attendance and presentation at the IAC has sparked an interest in the global aspect of the aerospace industry. I have also been to Iceland and to France as well and can't wait to explore more of the world!</p>
